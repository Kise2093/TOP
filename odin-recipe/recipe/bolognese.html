    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine!</p>
    <p> Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour.</p> 
    <p>It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours, you’ll take it from seriously delish to OMG this is amazing!!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Beef Cube</li>
        <li>Worcestershire</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Red Wine</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
    </ol>
